## Package Content

All the required metadata is available in the **sfpegQueueUtility** folder, which contains
* the `sfpegQueueable_UTL` utility class
* its `sfpegQueueable_UTL_TST` test class
* the `sfpegQueueableSetting__c` hierarchical custom setting providing some configuration constants
* the `sfpegQueueableLog__c` custom object storing queueable execution statistics

‚ö†Ô∏è It requires the [sfpegDebugUtility](/help/sfpegDebugUtility.md) to be deployed (part of the same **PEG_APEX** package),
as it relies on its features for debug logs.
